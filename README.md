# Cpp-Programs
Program 1: This repository contains Cpp programs from very basic to intermediate level!
Program 2: Write a C++ program to rotate an array by k elements. The final result should be stored in the original array.
            For example:
              1. if array is: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
              Value of k is : 3
              Updated array is: 4,5,6,7,1,2,3
              2. array is 3,6,7,9,10,5
              k= 2
              updated array is: 7,9,10,5,3,6
Program 3: Write a C Program which will do the following
              Input- array of size n (array will contain both negative and positive numbers)
              Output – Rearrange the array elements such that positive and negative numbers are placed alternatively 
              (if there are more negative or positive number then place them at the end of the array)
                For example
                  Input Array: [-1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6, -7, 8, 9]
                  Output Array: [9, -7, 8, -3, 5, -1, 2, 4, 6]
Program 4: Write a C Program which will accept an array and a value. Sort the array according to their absolute difference with the given value.
              For example
                Input array – [10,4,2,8,1]
                given value- 3
                Resultant array –[4,2,1,8,10]
                absolute difference of 2 and 3 = 1
                absolute difference of 10 and 3 = 7
                
Program 5: Write a program which accept an array, a range (low value, high value) and will do the following-
            Partition the array such that array is divide in three parts
            i) all elements smaller than low value came first.
            ii) all elements in range low value to high value come second
            iii) all elements greater than high value appears in the last.
            Individual elements of the three sets can appear in any order.
            For example
              Input: arr= {1, 14, 5, 20, 4, 2, 54, 20, 87, 98, 3, 1, 32}
              Low value = 14, High value = 20
              Output: arr= {1, 5, 4, 2, 1, 3, 14, 20, 20, 98, 87, 32, 54}
