Program 11:
          Point to Remember: 
              1. Setter are member functions of the class which are used to 
                 initialize the data member of the class for the object through 
                 which function is called (usage set_dataMember()). 
              2. Getter are the member functions of the class which are used to 
                 retrieve value of the data member for the object through which 
                 function is called (usage set_dataMember()). to_string() is a 
                 special function which returns the formatted value of the data memebers. 
              3. Each individual data member has their own setter and getter functions. 
              
          Problem Statement:
              You have to create a class, named Student, representing the student's 
              details, as mentioned bellow, and store the data of a student. 
                *age (int) 
                *first_name (string)
                *last_name (string)
                *standard (int). 
              Create setter and getter functions for each element; that is, the class
              should at least have following functions: 
                *get_age, set_age
                *get_first_name
                *set_first_name
                *get_last_name
                *set_last_name
                *get_standard
                *set_standard 
              Also, you have to create another method to_string() which returns the 
              string consisting of the all the details of the student(separated by comma).
              You can refer to stringstream for this.
          Write the main() which will create an object of the class. Initialize the data 
          members of the class one by one by calling their setter function. Once you 
          initialization is done call the getter functions one by one to retrieve the 
          value of the data member. At last you have to print all details of the student 
          separated by coma (can be done by the to-string()).
