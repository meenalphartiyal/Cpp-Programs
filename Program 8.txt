           height as the data members and calculateArea(), calculateVolume() 
           will be its member function.
           CalculateArea() will return the area of the Room.
           calculateVolume() will return the volume of the room.
           
           Write the main function which will create the object the class and 
           initialize the data members. Also call the calculateArea() and 
           calculateVolume() of the class using the object.
