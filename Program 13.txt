Program 13:
          Points to Remember: 
              1. Perform or call I/O functions through the main function. 
                 Class Member function are always used for initialisation,
                 calculations, and return the calculated values or data member values. 
              2. You cannot rename the data members and member function names. It 
                 should be as mentioned. 
          Problem Statements: 
              Design a class named Box whose dimensions are integers and private 
              to the class. The dimensions are labelled: length, breadth, and height.
                   *The default constructor of the class should initialize data members to 0.
                   *The parameterized constructor Box (int box_length, int box_breadth, int 
                    box_height) should initialize Box's length, breadth, and height to box_length,
                    box_breadth and box_height. ï‚· The copy constructor Box (Box B) should set 
                    length, breadth, height and to B's length, breadth and height, respectively.
                   *Apart from the above, the class should have functions: 
                       i. int getLength() - Return box's length 
                       ii. int getBreadth() - Return box's breadth
                       iii. int getHeight() - Return box's height 
                       iv. long long CalculateVolume() - Return the volume of the box 
          
          Now, in the main function create 3 object of the class and call each of the member function of Class Box.
