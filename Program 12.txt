Program 12:
          Points to Remember: 
              1. Perform or call I/O functions through the main function. 
                 Class Member function are always used for initialisation,
                 calculations, and return the calculated values or data member values. 
              2. You cannot rename the data members and member function names. It 
                 should be as mentioned. 
          Problem Statements: 
              Create a class named Student with the following specifications:
                 *An instance variable named score to hold a student's exam scores.
                 *A void input() function that reads integers and saves them to.
                 *An int calculateTotalScore() function that returns the sum of the 
                  student's scores. Now create a main function, which will create 2 
                  instances of the above class. Initialize the data member scores 
                  of both instances. Find out which is having better score.
