           Partition the array such that array is divide in three parts
           i) all elements smaller than low value came first.
           ii) all elements in range low value to high value come second
           iii) all elements greater than high value appears in the last.
           Individual elements of the three sets can appear in any order.
For example
   Input: arr= {1, 14, 5, 20, 4, 2, 54, 20, 87, 98, 3, 1, 32}
   Low value = 14, High value = 20
   Output: arr= {1, 5, 4, 2, 1, 3, 14, 20, 20, 98, 87, 32, 54}
